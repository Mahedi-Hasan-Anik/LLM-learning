## **What is the Transformer model and how does it differ from previous sequence transduction models?**  
The **Transformer** is a neural network architecture for **sequence transduction tasks** (such as machine translation) that relies **solely on attention mechanisms**.  

Unlike previous dominant models that used **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** or **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with attention, the Transformer completely **abandons recurrence and convolutions**.  

### **Key Benefits of Transformers:**
‚úÖ **Faster training** due to parallelization  
‚úÖ **Better long-range dependency learning**  
‚úÖ **Improved performance** on NLP tasks  

---

## **How does the Transformer achieve computational efficiency and learn long-range dependencies?**  
The **key to efficiency** in Transformers is **self-attention**.  

- **Traditional recurrent models** process input **sequentially**, limiting parallelization.  
- **Self-attention** enables **all elements in a sequence** to attend to each other **simultaneously**.  
- This results in **constant computational complexity (O(1))**, compared to **O(n)** sequential operations in RNNs.  
- The **path length between input and output positions** is constant, making **long-range dependencies easier to learn**.  

---

## **What is "self-attention" and how does it work within the Transformer?**  
**Self-attention**, also called **intra-attention**, allows the Transformer to relate different positions within a sequence.  

### **How Self-Attention Works:**
1. Compute **queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V)** for each input token.  
2. Compute the **dot product of queries and keys** to determine importance.  
3. Apply **softmax** to normalize attention scores.  
4. Compute a **weighted sum of values** based on attention scores.  

This allows **each word in a sentence** to attend to **every other word**, regardless of distance.

---

## **What is the significance of "Multi-Head Attention" in the Transformer?**  
Instead of using a **single** attention function, Transformers use **Multi-Head Attention**.

### **Why Multi-Head Attention?**
‚úÖ **Projects Q, K, and V into multiple subspaces**, capturing different features  
‚úÖ **Enhances the model‚Äôs ability** to attend to different parts of input  
‚úÖ **Improves representation learning**  

**Process:**
- Input embeddings are projected into **multiple heads**.
- Attention is computed **independently** for each head.
- Outputs are **concatenated** and transformed into final attention representation.

---

## **How do positional encodings enable the Transformer to understand sequence order?**  
Transformers **lack recurrence** (unlike RNNs), so they **require explicit positional information**.

### **How Positional Encodings Work:**
- **Sine and cosine functions** are used to encode positions.
- Each position has a **unique encoding vector**.
- These encodings are **added to input embeddings** to provide position awareness.

This enables the Transformer to process **longer sequences** than it was trained on.

---

## **What are the main components of the Transformer architecture?**  
The Transformer follows an **encoder-decoder structure**:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Encoder:**
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Captures dependencies within input.
- **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**: Applies transformations.
- **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections**: Stabilizes training.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Decoder:**
- **Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Prevents seeing future tokens.
- **Encoder-Decoder Attention**: Allows decoder to attend to encoder outputs.
- **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**: Processes decoder outputs.

Both **encoder and decoder stacks** use **residual connections** and **positional encodings**.

---

## **What training techniques are crucial to the success of the Transformer model?**  
Several **training strategies** help Transformers generalize:

‚úÖ **Learning Rate Scheduling**  
   - Uses **Adam optimizer** with a **warm-up phase**.  
   - Decays **proportional to the inverse square root of step number**.

‚úÖ **Residual Dropout**  
   - Dropout **prevents overfitting**.  
   - Applied to **each sub-layer‚Äôs output**.

‚úÖ **Label Smoothing**  
   - **Prevents overconfidence** in predictions.  
   - Encourages the model to **assign probability mass more smoothly**.

---

## **How does the Transformer model perform on machine translation tasks?**  
The Transformer achieves **state-of-the-art performance** on **machine translation**.

‚úÖ **Higher BLEU scores** than RNN/CNN-based models.  
‚úÖ **Faster training** due to parallelization.  
‚úÖ **Better handling of long-range dependencies**.  

It **outperforms ensembles** of previous models, showing that **self-attention effectively encodes syntax and semantics**.
